# sitdownpls
This is the index page of Sit Down Pls web store.
In this project I used the following stack:

- CSS Grid.
- Gulp bundler.
- scss.
- adaptive semantic mark-up.
- Pixel Perfect for all media queries.
- BEM naming.
- use of Vanilla JS, mostly all the time.
- convenient UX/UI: hover, focus, active (as shown in UIkit).
- HTML & CSS tags are valid.
